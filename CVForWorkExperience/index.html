    <h1>Karl Sargant's CV</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Karl Sargant and I would like to work at your establishment, as my great work ethic alongside my knowledge of several programming lanugages including JavaScript, HTML and CSS will make me a great asset to your organisation.</p>

    <h2>Achievements and educational history</h2>
    <p>I have experience in several programming languages, including the following:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My experience in these languages allows me to program websies that have several functions, an example being a website that contins a surevy that is able to return a variety of answers based upon the inputs left on the form it is hosted on</p>
    <h2>Goals for the future</h2>
    <p>I plan to develop my own games in the future, creating a piece of art for people to enjoy the experience of, complete with appropiate themes and a fitting end to each character's arcs.</p>
